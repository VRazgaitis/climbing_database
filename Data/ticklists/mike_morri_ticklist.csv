Good rest before headwall

Last clip to anchor is crux - do t rest too much after clipping bolt. Move quickly on the crimps, then do big committing move to the jug just right of the anchor

4/22/24,Loompa,5.10+,"Very fun, but feels more like 11a.

Crux is middle (around bolt 3?). There’s a big wayco, but only the top part of its LHS is good - need to throw for that.

3/24/24,Botanical Gardens,5.10a,"Amazing route - Definitely repeat.

Boulder Problem at the bottom. Definitely stick clip.

Very pleasant slab climbing with positive holds all the way. Encourages good climbing where feet follow hands. 

Bolts are spaced out at times, but climbing feels secure all the way, especially because of the very good tik marks.

3/24/24,Monkey in the Middle,5.11a,"Very fun - definitely repeat. Jimmy will like this.

Sent on 2nd attempt.

Jugs all the way through, but long, pumpy, and steep at times.

Need to find good rests to send. First one is obvious. Second one is slightly trickier to find. Need to find a place with decent holds where you can place whole foot flat on surface, kinda like a heel hook. Rest longer than you think you need.

Crux is steeper section in upper part - just keep going quickly here, because it eases up after, and you can rest.

Before the anchors, there’s a slightly tricky bit where you have to get over the bulge. Use jugs and step high, then it’s okay.",https://www.mountainproject.com/route/106127925/monkey-in-the-middle,1,Kentucky > Red River Gorge > Natural Bridge Region > The Zoo > The Old Zoo,3.5,-1,Lead,Redpoint,Sport,,80,4600
3/24/24,Skin The Cat,5.11a,"Pretty good - try to send next time!

Two full rests. On normal one chilling on ledge. Next one lying down in the crack with toe hook for security.

Crux at top. My beta was:
1. using right foot on side wall to get chicken head
2. Then need to use (1) right hand bad sloper and (2)  high left foot to go for very reachy left hand (but it’s a good hold)
3. Keep moving up the blank section and find left hand slit in between bulge
4. Keep moving up - not many holds. Match feet to get right foot on right side wall. Then can reach out to RHS arete with right hand
5. Rest is okay

3/24/24,Chimp,5.10b,"Fun slab, albeit a bit sketchy at times. Good for mixing in some slab into RRG trip.

High first clip. A bit sketch but ultimately okay. Afterwards there’s a sketchy move where you have to just stand up on a right foot and trust it. Shortly after there’s another crux, but it’s okay if you take your time and find the holds.

3/23/24,Johnny on Roofies,5.11a,"Fun jug fest except for crux and awkward start. Repeat if in the area.

Awkward start getting into the bulge. Mind your head and wear helmet. Easy afterwards until steep bulge (maybe heel hook or just step up high on bulge). This is followed by another steep bulge).

3/23/24,Smack Dab,5.11b,"Nice route that’s more technical than usual RRG. Try to send next time.

Some thin moves - gets quite tricky towards the top. At one point, you just have to stand up on sketchy left foot without any decent hand holds - after standing up, there are decent hand holds.

Probably need to re-learn beta and then go for redpoint.",https://www.mountainproject.com/route/118844637/smack-dab,1,Kentucky > Red River Gorge > Pendergrass-Murray Recreational Preserve (PMRP) > The Gallery,2.6,-1,Lead,Fell/Hung,Sport,,50,4900
3/23/24,The Last Supper,5.11a,"Fun route with diverse climbing. Spicy anchor clipping. Repeat if time!

Tricky crux low down, moving from right side pull to next right side pull above. Use sketchy high left foot, then throw for next right side pull with left hand. Then step through with right foot into big pocket. Slab part above is easy. Anchor is hard to clip - get right hand pinch and directly clip into mussy hook as soon as possible.
